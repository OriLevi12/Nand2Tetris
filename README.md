# Nand2Tetris Projects ðŸš€

This repository contains my **Nand2Tetris** projects, where I learn how to build a computer from the ground up using the **Hack Assembly language** and digital logic.

## ðŸ“Œ Current Progress
I have completed the first **5 projects** of the course:

- **Project 1-3:** Designing logic gates, building the ALU, and implementing RAM using HDL.
- **Project 4:** Writing Hack Assembly programs (`Mult.asm`, `Fill.asm`).
- **Project 5:** Building the complete Hack computer by implementing the `CPU`, `Memory`, and `Computer` chips in HDL.

I plan to continue working on the next projects, which include writing a Virtual Machine translator and eventually developing a simple operating system.

## âš¡ Running the Projects
To test the assembly programs (`.asm` files), you can use the **CPU Emulator** provided in the Nand2Tetris software suite:
1. Open the `CPU Emulator`.
2. Load an `.asm` file.
3. Run the program and observe the results.

To simulate the hardware components (`.hdl` files), use the **Hardware Simulator**:
1. Open the `Hardware Simulator`.
2. Load a `.hdl` file and its corresponding `.tst` test script.
3. Run the test and verify the output.

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- **Hack Assembly Language** (Low-level programming)
- **Nand2Tetris Software Suite** (CPU Emulator, Hardware Simulator)
- **Hardware Description Language (HDL)** (For logic gate and chip design)

## ðŸ“¢ Notes
This repository is a work in progress as I continue learning. Stay tuned for more updates! ðŸ˜ŠðŸš€
